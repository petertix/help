## Getting Started

### General Information
* Snapshots, not Differences.

* Nearly every operation is local.

* Integrity - SHA-1 Hash (40 Characters).

* 3 States that files can reside in:
    * Committed - Safely stored in the local database.
    * Modified - Changed, not commited.
    * Staged - Marked to go into the next commit.

* fetch imports commits from a remote repo into your local repo.
* Commits are stored as remote branches instead of normal local branches.
* pull = fetch + merge
* git pull --rebase  origin   ← Same as git pull but instead of git merge, git rebase
* git pull --rebase  origin  == fetch + rebase


## Useful git Commands

|Git task|	Notes|	Git commands|
|--------|-------|--------------|
| config | List the current config file |  `git config --list` |
| | Configure the author name and email address to be used with your commits. Note that Git strips some characters (for example trailing periods) from user.name.| `git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"` |
| | |`git config --global user.email sam@example.com`|
| | |`git config --global http.proxy http://my-proxy.com` |
| | | `git config --global https.proxy https://my-proxy.com` |
| | Alias for pull to do a fetch + rebase (no merge) | `git config pull.rebase=true` |
|Create a new local repository| | `git init`|
| Check out a repository | Create a working copy of a local repository:	| `git clone /path/to/repository`|
| | For a remote server, use:	| `git clone username@host:/path/to/repository`|
| Add files |  Add one or more files to staging (index):|`git add filename` |
| | Track new files | `git add *` |
| |  | `git add *.c` |
| | | `git add file.c` |
| Commit | Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository):	| `git commit -m "Commit message"`|
| | Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then:	| `git commit -a` |
| | Commit and signoff, opens editor to add comments | `git commit -s` |
| | Commit without running precommit tests | `git commit -n` |
| | To modify the comment of your last commit, before a push | `git commit —amend` |
| Squash commits | Squash all commits into one before a push | `git log --oneline` |
| | Interactively | `git rebase -i (commit hash)` |
| | Squash all commits | `git rebase - root -i` |
| Push | Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository:	| `git push origin master`|
| Status |	List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit:	|`git status`|
| | Short status | `git status -s` |
| diff | What changes were made | `git diff  file.c` |
| | | `git diff  --staged` |
| | For a list of files to be pushed | `git diff --stat --cached [remote/branch] `|
| rm | Remove a file | `git rm file.c` |
| mv | rename a file | `git mv file1.c  file2.c` |
|Connect to a remote repository| If you haven't connected your local repository to a remote server, add the server to be able to push to it:|`git remote add origin <server>`|
| Log | List all the commits to this repo | `git log` |
| | List files commited to a branch | `git log --oneline` |
| | List the files that were changed in each commit | `git log --stat` |
| | | `git log —names-only` |
| | |`git —name-status` |
| | List changeset from 2 commits ago | `git log  -p  -2` |
| | Format the logs | `git log  --pretty=format:"%h  %s"  --graph` | 
| | List commits since 2 weeks ago | `git log  --since=2.weeks`|
| | List all currently configured remote repositories:|	`git remote -v`|
|Branches| Create a new branch and switch to it:	| `git checkout -b <branchname>`|
| | Switch from one branch to another:	|`git checkout <branchname>`|
| | List all the branches in your repo, and also tell you what branch you're currently in:	|`git branch --all` |
| | Delete the feature branch:	|`git branch -d <branchname> `|
| | Push the branch to your remote repository, so others can use it:	| `git push origin <branchname>` |
| | Push all branches to your remote repository:	| `git push --all origin` |
| | Delete a branch on your remote repository: | `git push origin :<branchname>` |
| Update from the remote repository | Fetch and merge changes on the remote server to your working directory:	| `git pull` |
| |To merge a different branch into your active branch:	| `git merge <branchname>` | 
| | View all the merge conflicts: | `git diff` |
| | View the conflicts against the base file: | `git diff --base <filename>` | 
| | Preview changes, before merging: | `git diff <sourcebranch> <targetbranch>`|
| | After you have manually resolved any conflicts, you mark the changed file:	| `git add <filename>` |
| Tags | You can use tagging to mark a significant changeset, such as a release:	|  `git tag 1.0.0 <commitID>` |
| | List all tags | `git tag` |
| | CommitId is the leading characters of the changeset ID, up to 10, but must be unique. Get the ID using:	| `git log` |
| | Push all tags to remote repository:	|  `git push --tags origin` |
| | Checkout version v1.2.1 with tag: v1.2.1 |`git checkout v1.2.1` |
| show | List info | `git show`|
| | | `git show —pretty=(short-medium-full-fuller-raw)` |
| Undo local changes |  If you mess up, you can replace the changes in your working tree with the last content in head: Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept. |  `git checkout -- <filename>` |
| | Instead, to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it, do this:	| `git fetch origin` |
| | | `git reset --hard origin/master` |
| To sync with the origin | List the current origin | `git remote -v` |
| To modify the comment |  Of your last commit, before a push | `git commit —amend` |
| To sync with the origin | List the Current origin  |  `git remote -v` |
| |  Switch to the master branch |`git checkout master` |
| | Fetch and Rebase | `git pull  --rebase` |
| | Switch back to your branch |  `git checkout my-new-branch` |
| | Put your changes on top of everyone elses | `git rebase master` |
| | Push the branch to the origin | `git push origin my-new-branch` |
| Search |  Search the working directory for foo():	| `git grep "foo()"` |
| Help | |`git help  <verb>` |
| | | `git help config`| 
| stash | Switch branches without doing a commit | `git stash` |
| | List the stashes | `git stash list` |
| | Switch branch and do other work | `git checkout branch-2` |
| | After the commit and push, return to branch-1 | `git checkout branch-1` |
| | Apply the stash to be right back before the interruption | `git stash apply` | 
| | Can also pop the stash stack | `git stash pop` |
| | Unapply a stash | `git stash show -p stash@{0}` |
| | | `git apply -R` |
| | Create a branch from a stash | `git stash branch testchanges`|
| | | |
